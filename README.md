# Latte Art Fluid Simulator

I made a latte art simulator, because I enjoy latte art in real life, and that sparked my interest in fluid simulations.

## Want to Learn Fluid Simulation?
This repo is build on top of off the Eulerian fluid simulator from Ten Minute Physics that I ported to TypeScript and significantly refactored for better encapsultation, and to separate the HTML sizing math from the physics. I fixed the canvas sizing math so that there is no more white space within the black frame and canvas drawing is clearer since  it takes into account devicePixelRatio.

If you're learning fluid simulation for the first time, I'd recommend watching his video, and then looking at my `no_latte_art` branch.

`no_latte_art` branch is also here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-niznck?file=index.ts
